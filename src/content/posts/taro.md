# Grapefruit Jasmine Green Tea

_Published on: 12/09/2023_

One of the most high effort recipes, I remember peeling 18 grapefruits and removing all the fibres by hand, extracting just the pulp to make it for RC4's IG fair. Very refreshing drink though, well worth it.

## Ingredients (for 1 person)

- 2 Jasmine green tea bags (I used Dilmah's Jasmine Green Tea)
- 100 mL of hot water
- 30 mL of fresh milk (I used Greenfield's)
- 4 tsp Taro powder (I used Redman's)
- 2 tbsp of creamer (I used Coffeemate's)

If you want to add in pearls, these are the ingredients you will need:

- Brown sugar
- Pearl (I got it from Redman)
- Water

## Instructions

To make the pearls:

1. boil the water and add in the pearls. Boil for approximately 30 minutes, then let it rest for 10 minutes. Afterwards, strain the pearls into a container.
1. Dissolve liberal amounts of brown sugar in water and add it to a pan. Reduce the sugar water slightly and add in the pearls to cook further, until the pearls are sweet and the syrup is thick.

To make the taro milk tea:

1. Steep the jasmine green tea bags in hot water for around 2 minutes.
1. Add in the taro powder, creamer, and fresh milk. Mix well and enjoy it with ice.
