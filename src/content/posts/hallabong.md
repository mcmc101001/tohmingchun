# Mint Hallabong Jasmine Green Tea

_Published on: 10/11/2023_

Welcome to my _new series_ where I will be sharing my tea recipes! This is a collection of recipes I have come up with at RC4 Tea and I'm always pleasantly surprised by how well they turn out. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do!

## Ingredients (for 1 person)

- 1 tbsp of green tea leaves and 1 tbsp of jasmine tea leaves (I got mine from Pek Sin Choon)
- 2 tbsp of hallabong syrup (Available at _(shockingly)_ Sheng Shiong or some Korean marts)
- Mint leaves
- 200 mL of hot water
- Canned aloe vera (optional)

## Instructions

1. Steep the green tea leaves, jasmine tea leaves, and mint leaves in hot water for 1 minute. I used approximately 3 mint leaves torn up. Make sure the water is not too hot as it will extract the astringent notes of the tea.
1. Strain the tea leaves and mint leaves, mix in the hallabong syrup and shake/mix well with ice.
1. Add in the canned aloe vera, garnish with mint and enjoy!
