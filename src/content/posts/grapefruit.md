# Grapefruit Jasmine Green Tea

_Published on: 16/8/2023_

One of the most high effort recipes, I remember peeling 18 grapefruits and removing all the fibres by hand, extracting just the pulp to make it for RC4's IG fair. Very refreshing drink though, well worth it.

## Ingredients (for 1 person)

- Grapefruit syrup
- 2 Jasmine green tea bags (I used Dilmah's Jasmine Green Tea)
- 200 mL of hot water

## Instructions

1. To make the grapefruit syrup, peel the grapefruits and remove all the fibres, leaving only the pulp. Get a sterilized container (I used hot water to sterilize it) and layer in pulp and sugar like how one would layer a lasagna. I used around 1:1 ratio of pulp to sugar. Leave it in the fridge for a few days, and the sugar will pull out the water from the grapefruit and you will get a thick syrup.
1. Steep the jasmine green tea bags in hot water for around 2 minutes.
1. Add in the grapefruit syrup to taste and enjoy it with ice. I used around 3 tablespoons of syrup.
